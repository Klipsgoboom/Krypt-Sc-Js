Krypt-sc is a WIP interpreted coding language.

The programming language was originally intended to only be used to run applications in my WIP C++ OS.

Krypt-sc is now being built to rely on a simple syntax similar to JS and C# with some elements of Lua's syntax. The languages simplicity should allow rapid programming for applications like modding and game development.
